- title: Building the team
  description: Everything starts with the team. We put together a cross functional team with at least one person who has deep domain expertise in the problem we are solving. At this stage the team could be internal or we could bring in an external founder(s).

- title: Mapping user stories
  description: Next we spend a lot of time speaking with potential customers, existing operators and advisors to get the lay of the land. After data collection we will run a series of design sprints to help us to identify key assumptions we need to validate.

- title: Prototyping
  description: Once we have clearly marked out user stories and the validated set of user outcomes we begin our 2 - 4 week prototype sprints. During these sprints we put together the components needed to validate our initial assumptions.

- title: Launching & Iterating
  description: Launch day is always exciting. It is when we are able to put our solution in front of potential customers and get feedback. This begins an iterative loop through which we begin to adjust and adapt the process.
