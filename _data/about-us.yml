- description: We are a small group of individuals who enjoy and take great pride in the work we do. Nothing is ever completely finished. We are constantly refining, improving and finding faster ways of getting things done. Everyday at work is an opportunity to test out new technologies and methods. We are constantly questioning the status quo and the way things have "always" been done.

We have an internal list of things we believe that can be dramatically improved. Our studio gives us the place to experiment and test our assumptions. On the other hand, our capital arm is driven to find other entrepreneurs and makers who are out solving similar problems.
